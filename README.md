# BottomsUp

## Vision Statement
For the adult, who enjoys mixology and convenience, BottomsUp is a one-stop cocktail web app that brings the user a wide variety of drink recipes based off ingredients they already own.

The user will be able to enter in any ingredients available to them and our product will return a list of possible drink recipes to make based off what they entered. The product will also allow users search for specific drinks and see which ingredients they are missing as well as instructions on how to make it. Users will be able to create personal accounts to save their entered ingredients and save specific recipes for later use.
