# BottomsUp

## Vision Statement
For the adult, who enjoys mixology and convenience, BottomsUp is a one-stop cocktail web app that brings the user a wide variety of drink recipes based off ingredients they already own.

The user will be able to enter in any ingredients available to them and our product will return a list of possible drink recipes to make based off what they entered. The product will also allow users search for specific drinks and see which ingredients they are missing as well as instructions on how to make it. Users will be able to create personal accounts to save their entered ingredients and save specific recipes for later use.

### Minimal Viable Product
#### Primary Features: 
- Personal account creation
- Enter ingredients into personal list for storage
- Return search results after ingredients have been entered
- Allow for searching of drinks based on drink name
- Display full recipes and images of drinks

#### Themes:
- Account management
- Record keeping
- Eduction
- Frugalness

## History
This project came together while brainstorming useful products for busy adults such as ourselves. The first iteration of this idea stemmed from a problem we noticed in which a lot of ingredients we have at home tend to go to waste if they dont align to a specific recipe we know. It's almost impossible to know every combination possible with a bunch of random ingredients so having an app which could do exaclty that would be immensely useful. In order to make this idea more realistic, we decided to narrow our focus on providing a ingredient and recipe database based on cocktails. This would allow a user to still make the most use of what they have on hand while also enjoying a drink they might not have known how to make otherwise.
