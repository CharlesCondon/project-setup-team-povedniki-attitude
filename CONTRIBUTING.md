## Git Workflow
* Pull from master branch to check for any recent changes made
* Branch before each task 
* Once task is complete, merge with master branch
* Pull from master once again
* Push all commits to original repo on Github

## Guidelines for Contributions
* Tasks and spikes are to be divided equally between team members
* Alert team members when work is pushed so the other members know to expect changes
* Have updates on progress ready prior to standups
* Ask for help on a task, if needed, early to avoid hangups in development

## Setting Up Local Environment
Clone repository through your command line using:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/agile-dev-assignments/project-setup-team-povedniki-attitude.git`<br>
Then open repository into your IDE of choice to begin contributions.

## Building and Testing
As shown above must first clone the repository onto your local machine. In order to install all the dependencies for the back end you must first open the terminal and cd into back-end. Then from there you must write npm install and then npm start. This will load up the back end server. Following this you must open up another terminal window and cd into front-end. From there you will again write npm install and then npm start. The terminal will then prompt you to run the app on another port because the back end will be running on port 3000, you must respond yes to this. After this the front end will load in your local browser.
