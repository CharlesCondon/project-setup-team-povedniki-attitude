# Contributing
## Team Values and Norms
#### Values:
* We strongly value communication between members and transparency to better meet our goals
* Punctuality is very important so that we can maintain our schedule and make deadlines
* Asking for assistance when stuck is strongly encouraged, as a team we must help out a member whenever something comes up
#### Norms:
* Zoom meeting times: Sundays @ 3:00pm
* Standups: Monday @ 4:45pm

## Git Workflow
* Pull from master branch to check for any recent changes made
* Branch before each task 
* Once task is complete, merge with master branch
* Pull from master once again
* Push all commits to original repo on Github

## Guidelines for Contributions
* Tasks and spikes are to be divided equally between team members
* Alert team members when work is pushed so the other members know to expect changes
* Have updates on progress ready prior to standups
* Ask for help on a task, if needed, early to avoid hangups in development
