# Contributing
## Team Values and Norms

## Git Workflow
* Pull from master branch to check for any recent changes made
* Branch before each task 
* Once task is complete, merge with master branch
* Pull from master once again
* Push all commits to original repo on Github

## Guidelines for Contributions
* Tasks and spikes are to be divided equally between team members
* Alert team members when work is pushed so the other members know to expect changes
* Have updates on progress ready prior to standups
* Ask for help on a task, if needed, early to avoid hangups in development

## Setting Up Local Environment
Clone repository through your command line using:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/agile-dev-assignments/project-setup-team-povedniki-attitude.git`<br>
Then open repository into your IDE of choice to begin contributions.
